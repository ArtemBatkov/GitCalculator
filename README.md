  A calculator is an app, which help us to make some daily computing. This app is being presented to your attention. 

                                                       FUNCTIONALITY
  The app has basic functions, such as, plus,minus,multiply,divide, but also advanced functionality: power, percent, square, factor, sin, cos, tg, ctg, log(decimal), 
ln(linear). To unlock advance functions you need to press "Fx" button. Also, specific constants, such as Ï€ and e(exp), were added here too. 

                                                       SPECIFICATION
  Due to calculate trigonometry equations, you need to know 2 main things. First, you have to close brackets everytime to achieve the goal, 
and be sure that correct answer will return. Second, the argument of the trigonometry function is always in Radian. There is a specific rule for the percent (%). 
If you want to know how much percent is on the value, you should to use the multiply operation. For example, the start value is 5, and we want to know how much 50% is, 
we have to type "5*50%", and the answer will be 2.50. Otherwise, a number with percent will divide by 100. For example, 5 + 50% = 5 + 50/100 = 5.5. Remember that. 
General Recommendation is ALWAYS CLOSE ALL BRACKETS to have a right answer.
